Collapse of a spherical, homogeneous gas cloud in pressure equilibrium with a surrounding, rarified medium.

The cloud can be initialized to have no bulk velocity (only pressure), random gaussian velocities, or a velocity distribution that follows a turbulent power spectrum generated with C. Federrath's TurbGen code.

Can be run with or without gravity, cooling & star formation.

See the example 'MakeUniformCloud' to generate the base IC file needed for this test.
